Feild Dimens:
Total: 27*54 feet

Base Line from Start: 7 ft 9.25 inches (7.77)
Length in ps: 120.00
.06475 fpp

---------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL NOTE: REVERSE POLARITY OF TURNS FOR OPPOSITE RED TEAM
---------------------------------------------------------------

Gear From Start (if in middle): Same as Base Line from Start
Gear From Start (linear, if on sides): 10.55 ft.
Width From Flat to Flat of Airship: 8 ft 5 in
Distance from center to outer positions: TBD (FIND OUT)
Angle for side gear deposits from base line: 45 degrees
NOTE: Retrieval Wall and Side Gear Walls are roughly paralell, at least enough that it will self-correct


9.67 feet is distance from center gear peg to blue alliance wall feeder
From side bL to gear peg is -55 degrees in turn
Distance for above is 4.25 feet
10.71 feet from side gear holder to retreival feeders
19.43 feet from opposite side midpoint of baseline run to boiler to dump (angle from init midpoint: 97.5 degrees)
4.74 feet: above, but same side as boiler (angle from init midpoint: 115.7 degrees)
12.17 feet: above, but from center (angle from midpoint of init: 101 degrees)

The following decribes the procedure for going from the opposite gear peg to the retreival zone:

	Distance from midpoint of init run to retreival zone is 20.72, angle of 86 degrees
	
	
From center line to retreival: 13.12 at 85 degrees from forward


Changes:






Servos consolidated and fixed double-set


Stuff to do:
	Finish TurnForAngle
	Check DriveForDistance
	Calibrate
	Write Auto Programs
	Camera(s)
	Camera Switching Code
	
	
Potential Issues:
	Motor Declarations
	Subsystem Interruptions

The program I've written may or may not break immediately on startup. We will see.
